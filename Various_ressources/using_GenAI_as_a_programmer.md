# Using GenAI for programming

## Introduction

Many software engineers are thinking about how to use AI-powered tools for programming. How can we use these? Will they replace us? The introduction of these tools has drawn a lot of attention.

In this article, we will discuss ways we can leverage text-based Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to assist with various programming tasks. Some of what we will cover include:

1. Writing bash commands
2. Creating regular expressions
3. Making SQL queries
4. Testing and Refactoring
5. While exciting, these tools aren’t perfect, and we will also discuss their limitations and concerns.

Whether you’re an experienced software engineer or someone new to programming, AI tools can be leveraged to save us work and time. Let’s get started.

## 1. Bash Commands

The terminal is a powerful tool that allows us to write Bash commands that can read and manipulate our computer systems. Even for experienced programmers writing complex terminal commands can be challenging. There are an infinite number of useful commands, and we learn about new ones all the time.

When trying to work on a terminal or filesystem, we often wonder, “Is there a command for that?” With Generative AI tools, we have a new way to find out.

Simply ask the Generative AI tool for a command that does the task you are trying to do. Consider prompts like:

“What is a Terminal command that will list all of the files on my Mac in the file directory that begin with the current year?”
“What is the bash command that will squash my git history?”
“How can I use Command Prompt to search for program files that use the Customer class?”
Generative AI tools will often come up with a useful command for what we are trying to do!

It’s important to note that Generative AI tools can make mistakes. It is crucial to have a decent understanding of bash to ensure that we know what the commands are doing before we run them. One should be especially careful when running destructive commands such as ones that delete files like rm -rf <folder>.

## 2. Regular expressions

Regular expressions are syntax to describe patterns found within text. We often use them within bash commands, unit tests, or validation. The creation of regular expressions can be a time-consuming and frustrating task. The syntax is quite hard to read and errors are hard to spot. Generative AI can help.

It is important to have a well-defined set of test cases to ensure that the created patterns are working as intended. Make sure to test your regular expressions in a safe environment in case there are small errors - one small mistake in a regular expression can make the whole thing useless! Online regular expression checkers can be helpful when testing your regular expression on a test case.
