# Abdelhaq's Articles Repository

Welcome to my Articles Repository! I'm Abdelhaq Bensghir, a Senior Data Consultant with a fervent passion for cloud, data, and product development. Here, I delve into various topics, spanning from data science to technology and beyond. My articles fuse technical insights with creative thinking, striving to popularize data-related subjects and ignite meaningful discussions.

## Why do I write here?

After bidding farewell to Medium, I am migrating all my articles here on GitHub. It's a platform where ideas flourish freely, fostering a community of curious minds eager to explore the realms where data meets imagination.

Feel free to explore, engage, and embark on this journey of exploration and discovery alongside me!
