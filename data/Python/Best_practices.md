1. local environment:
    In Python, it is best practice to create a workspace-specific environment, for example, by using a local environment (There are two types of environments that you can create for your workspace: virtual and conda. These environments allow you to install packages without affecting other environments, isolating your workspace's package installations).

    A conda environment is a Python environment that's managed using the conda package manager.Choosing between conda and virtual environments depends on your packaging needs, team standards, etc.
