## Introduction

Addiction to cell phones is an issue that touches large groups of users across generations. If you question this assertion, just look around when getting in the subway or in the bus... At this point the issue seems to be evident, and this article is intended to reflect on what may be among its main reasons.

There are for sure numerous factors that end up making us attached more than ever to our cell phones. To cite a few:

- Light weight and ease of use,
- Access to information : “By the end of 2022, the world produced 94 zettabytes of data” (Source: Finances Online), and talking about how much data is created every day the current estimate stands at 1.145 trillion MB per day,
- The last but not least factor is addictive social media apps powered by cutting-edge user adoption research.

I find however that there is quite an important reason at the root of all the interest we dedicate to our phones; the value we perceive within these devices.

## Cell phones value perception

Using and holding our phones all the time comes from our own perception of the intrinsic value they bring to our daily life. Compared to books or real-life discussions with others, many may prefer using their phone to call their friend or to get a piece of information a book might offer. Interestingly, this behavior doesn’t come from the real added value of the phone, but from the perceived value, and here lies all the difference.

Let’s take a use case and compare writing on paper and writing on a cell phone or even a laptop. When grabbing a pen and starting to write, you incur no risk of distraction, and you get as a result a fruitful experience with a well spent time. In contrast, opening your phone and trying to write may be a hazardous adventure, and chances are you end up being hooked by your social media feed!

Even when considering times of rest, phones do not help to recover more than the other alternatives. In the end, the most useful, distraction-free way to acquire knowledge is through reading books, taking notes, and handwriting, and the most straightforward stress-free way to pause and recharge is in practicing sports, having some quality time with relatives or friends, or getting involved in any other useful group activities.

Of all that preceded, it is rather clear that the value we attach to our cell phones may be questionable, and this may be the first step in breaking free from the related addiction.

To sum up, this article did try focusing on explaining one reason: the biased perception of the added value of our cell phones. For sure, this isn’t the only reason, and this contemporary addiction issue is way more complex to address than writing one single article. This article is, as a result, no more than one tiny piece within the puzzle, among many other explanatory variables that may have led to the widespread addiction when it comes to phone usage.

To dive deep in the subject, I suggest a documentary that may shift the way you consider some things: *The Social Dilemma*

*The Social Dilemma* by Jeff Orlowski explores the negative consequences of the social media phenomenon among teens and young adults. The film interviews former employees of top technology companies such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Mozilla, gleaning their opinions on how these companies have strong influences in today’s social, cultural, and political realms and not for the better. Have a good time watching it!
